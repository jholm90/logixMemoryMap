# Open Questions

**Two.** Down from forty. OQ-OPERANDSHAPE closed negative in the latest batch. Closed questions and their reasoning trails are in
`RESOLVED_QUESTIONS.md`; the capture batch after the blind set closed five at once
(JSRCALLERBASE, RUNGSHAPE, ALARMCONDREAL, BUILDFAIL-OPEN, MODULENAMELEN).

## The bar for opening a new one

**State, before any file is built, how many percentage points it should move on the
seventeen real programs and by what mechanism.**

If the mechanism is a category scale, it is already answered: an eight-parameter
per-category fit, fitted directly on the held-out real programs — cheating, an upper
bound no honest procedure can beat — reaches mean 1.01% / max 2.59% and **still
fails** the stopping rule. Under leave-one-out it is worth **0.007 percentage
points**, with half the files getting worse.

So **every question whose mechanism was "a cost constant is slightly wrong" has a
measured maximum payoff of approximately zero**, however cleanly it would answer.
That is why thirty-four closed at once; a thirty-fifth, literal operands, closed on its real-program exposure.

## What is left

| question | state |
|---|---|
| **OQ-REALUNDER** | The real residual: **3.07% mean, 5.99% worst** on the seventeen standard-processor real programs present, after a compensating error was removed. |
| **OQ-PROGSCOPESTRUCT** | Program-scoped UDT and array tags — in 14 of 17 real programs, densest in the three worst, never built. 12 files built, awaiting capture. |

## 1. OQ-REALUNDER — the residual itself

**Standard processors only: mean 3.07%, worst 5.99%, every one of the seventeen
standard-processor real programs present under-predicting.** Safety processors are
excluded from accuracy (CLAUDE.md, Platform scope). Including export 13, the one
safety program in the original set: mean 3.12%, worst 6.0% (sum-weighted +3.20%). That is worse than the 1.74% it read before
this batch, and the difference is a correction, not a regression:

- The per-caller `jsr_fixed_base_per_routine` (5,096) had only ever been measured on
  files with ONE caller routine, and was charged to every caller in real programs —
  10 to 87 of them. `jsrcallers_k*` proved a caller costs what any routine costs
  (OQ-JSRCALLERBASE). Removing the over-charge took the real set from 1.74% to 3.40%.
- The AOI argument cost (input references at 28, not 16) moved it back to 3.12%.
- The 2198 family repeat discount moved it to 3.13% — right on the Kinetix files,
  slightly wrong-way on real programs that carry many drives.
- The one-time 264 an RLL file with AOI calls carries moved it to 3.12%.
- Excluding safety processors from accuracy, and pricing structured JSR arguments as
  COP-style copies, leave the standard-processor figure at **3.07%**.

So about **3% of every real program is still unexplained**, and the old 1.7% figure was
that 3% partly cancelled by an error. This is CLAUDE.md failure mode 3 exactly, and the
right response is the same: keep the correct term, find the real one.

**What it tracks.** Everything size-like — programs (r = 0.92), routines (0.90),
rungs (0.86), tags (0.85) — and it is about 20% of the engine's `routine_logic` bytes.
No single count explains it under leave-one-out (best single term: JSR calls, LOO mean
1.16%, worst 4.9%), and a term fitted on the real set is not an answer anyway.

**Eliminated in the latest batch:**

- **Operand shape.** Member paths (`U.Bit`, `U.Sub.Bit`, `UA[2].Bit`, `U.Val`) cost
  exactly what plain tags cost on XIC, OTE and MOV — all 26 `opshape_*` files exact.
- **Trends.** 92 trend definitions across 11 of the 17 programs, unpriced, but the
  residual correlates *negatively* with trend and pen count (r = −0.23).
- **JSR.** Every case now measured and wired; 79 JSR files at 0.02% mean.

**Found and reported, not priceable:** source-protected content. Export 33 carries 39
protected routines (~305,000 encrypted characters) that the engine cannot see; the
engine now lists them as an unpriced gap instead of charging zero silently. It is the
second-worst file, so part of its 5.6% is this, but no calibration from ciphertext to
compiled size exists.

**What distinguishes real programs from the generated files that fit.** The
multi-program composites (`composite_realistic_v3/v4`, `v3abl_*`: 7–11 programs,
JSR callers and targets, AOIs, modules) land within ±1% on the corrected engine. The
largest structural difference between them and real programs is **operand shape** —
see OQ-OPERANDSHAPE.

**Second blind set — exports 37–42, predicted before any reading existed:**

| export | controller | actual | predicted before the reading | error | inside the pre-written range |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 37 | 5069-L330ERMS2 | 1,572,161 | 1,495,547 | −4.87% | yes |
| 38 | 1756-L81ES | 2,007,604 | 1,832,104 | −8.74% | no (below) |
| 39 | 5069-L340ERS2 | 2,935,942 | 2,811,103 | −4.25% | yes |
| 40 | 5069-L320ERMS2 | 1,279,555 | 1,211,456 | −5.32% | yes |
| 41 | 5069-L310ERS2 | 511,973 | 481,589 | −5.93% | no (below) |
| 42 | 1769-L33ERMS | 884,640 | 840,245 | −5.02% | yes — dead architecture, excluded from accuracy |

All six under-predict, by 4.2% to 8.7%; four of six inside the range written down in
advance. **None counts toward accuracy**: five are safety processors and one is a 1769,
both out of scope. They are recorded as evidence of direction only. On the five in scope the mean is 5.82%. Five are safety controllers, but their
safety content is small — one safety program, 2–8% of rungs — and does not explain it.

**Safety memory is a separate partition.** A safety controller keeps safety tags and
safety logic in its own memory, which does not count toward the standard memory that
Capacity reports for standard logic and data. Non-safety tags may not be used in a
safety program; safety tags MAY be used in standard programs, where they cost standard
**logic** (the reference) but not standard **tag** memory. The engine still sizes safety
routine logic (Class="Safety" programs) and Class="Safety" controller tags into the
standard total — 6.7 KB to 22.8 KB on the seven safety files with readings. The measured
296-byte safety task/program shell stays: it was fitted against real standard-memory
readings. Excluding the rest is the correct model and moves those files 0.7 to 1.9
points further under, so it is not the source of the gap.

**The confidence display is not calibrated to real error.** With the Subroutine
Overhead line gone, file confidence reads 97–99% on most real programs (export 07:
99.2%), while their real error is 2–6% (export 27: 98.5% confident, 6.0% wrong). The
bands describe how well each *component* is measured on isolation files; they say
nothing about the unexplained real residual. Until that residual is explained, the
file-level figure must carry it.

### What has been eliminated

Each of these was tested and failed. The full table is in `ROADMAP.md`; the
load-bearing ones:

- **Any per-routine, per-rung, per-program or per-tag constant.** All four are
  collinear with size, so each moves the bias and leaves the spread. **The remaining
  error is not a missing per-unit cost.**
- **Any flat per-file constant.** Swept from 2,000 to 10,000 bytes; every value made
  the mean worse, monotonically. A per-file term moves all files equally, so bias
  improves and spread does not.
- **A global `routine_logic` scale-up.** Ruled out twice — by 578 instruction rows,
  and by direct measurement in both directions on real programs.
- **Tag data space.** Every real tag shape is covered; the untested ones total a few
  thousand bytes. The name-length term is cleared by 88 clean rows at mean 0.12%.

**So both remaining shapes are eliminated: the residual is CONTENT-DEPENDENT.**
Neither counting structural units nor charging every file the same can reach it.

### Not available

Attribution by subtraction from a real export is dead by the read-only rule. The
Studio-side substitute — delete a category in Logix Designer, read Capacity twice — is
declined: each reading costs a bench session. A residual model fitted on the real
programs is judged by leave-one-out only and must beat 0.007 points.

## 2. OQ-PROGSCOPESTRUCT — does a UDT or array tag cost the same at program scope?

Program-scoped DINT tags are exact (`tagscope_*`, 10 to 1,000 tags). A program-scoped
**UDT or array** tag has never been built: an element sweep over the seventeen
standard-processor real programs found `Program/Tags/Tag/Data/Structure` and `/Array`
in 14 of them and in no generated file that captured clean. They are densest in the
three worst-predicted programs — exports 27, 06 and 33 carry 102, 118 and 157.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | a per-program tag table, or a per-tag cost for structured program tags, the engine does not charge |
| **Expected movement** | unknown until read; the three worst files carry the most of them |
| **Batch built** | 12 files, `gen_program_scope_struct.py`: the identical UDT tags (7 members) and DINT[20] arrays at controller scope vs program scope, at 10, 50 and 200 tags. 1756-L81E fw35, lint and confound clean |
